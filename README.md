# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on the dataset provided.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `creditcard.csv`. It contains anonymized credit card transaction data, including:
- **Time**: The elapsed time since the first transaction in seconds.
- **V1 to V28**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-transformed features to protect sensitive information.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Class**: The target variable (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Legitimate).

**Note**: The dataset is imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions being a small percentage of the total.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or duplicate values.
   - Normalize/scale features like `Amount` and `Time`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the distribution of features.
   - Identify correlations between features.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Use techniques like cross-validation for evaluation.
4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
   - Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or under-sampling.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: Data manipulation
  - NumPy: Numerical computations
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization
  - Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilal-codes05/Fraud-detection-ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fraud-detection-ML
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model.

## Results
The model achieves the following performance metrics:
- Accuracy: **X%**
- Precision: **X%**
- Recall: **X%**
- F1-score: **X%**
- AUC-ROC: **X%**

## Limitations
- The dataset is highly imbalanced, which may affect performance.
- The anonymized features limit interpretability of the model.

## Future Improvements
- Use deep learning techniques for improved performance.
- Incorporate additional features for better detection.
- Deploy the model using a web application (e.g., Flask or Streamlit).
